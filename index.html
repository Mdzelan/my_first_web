            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group 
                 of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas 
                  among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>

            <p>Web design involves creating the visual elements and layout of a website, while coding involves translating these 
                 designs into a functional website using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Typically, dedicated web 
                  developers translate the designs to code.</p>
